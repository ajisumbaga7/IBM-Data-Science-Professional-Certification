    "# 1. Introduction and Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to help tourists choose their destinations depending on what experiences the neighbourhoods have to offer and what the neighbourhoods would want to have. This also helps people make decisions if they are thinking about migrating to Paris or London or even if they want to relocate between neighbourhoods within the city.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It also will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life. Our findings will help stakeholders make informed decisions and address any concerns they have including the different kinds of cuisines, provision stores and what the city has to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Work Flow\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Approach\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm"
